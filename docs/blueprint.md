- Use custom icons related to travel milestones for each category (e.g., a plane for countries, a star for states).
- Dashboard layout should be clean and intuitive, emphasizing visual progress through progress bars, maps, and charts.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions between sections and updating progress indicators.
